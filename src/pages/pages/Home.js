    <p className="text">
      My name is Swatej Patil. I am a recent graduate from 
      <a href="https://ghrce.raisoni.net/" style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }} target="_blank" > G H Raisoni College of Engineering (GHRCE)</a>, Nagpur,
      an autonomous institution affiliated with 
      <a href="https://nagpuruniversity.ac.in/" style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }} target="_blank"> Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University (RTMNU)</a>.
      I earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering with an 8.4 CPGA out of 10, which
      equates to a 3.8/4.0 GPA on the US grading scale.

      My areas of interest in research are blockchain, machine learning, cybersecurity, cryptography,
      and the security of mobile platforms. Machine learning has the potential to greatly enhance several
      facets of cybersecurity, which interests me particularly.
      I am a member of  <a href="https://owasp.org/" style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }} target="_blank">
      Open Web Application Security Project(OWASP)</a>, which is a nonprofit foundation dedicated
      to improving software security.

      My brother and I founded the Swatej Foundation in 2019, a non-profit organization dedicated
      to making the world a better place for stray animals. My ambition is to create a Disneyland for dogs.

      When I'm not pursuing my intellectual interests, you may find me practicing and playing pool.
      I'm hoping to win the US Open 9-ball one day.
